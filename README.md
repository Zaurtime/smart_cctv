 ## SUPERUSER SITE ADMIN FUNCTION:
This site uses Django's Admin functionality for content moderation control. The site has a Superuser with their own login credentials.
 
The Admin panel can be accessed simply from the home page. You can navigate to it by clicking in the URL bar, hit / (forward slash) on keyboard and type admin. Like so: **/admin** and hit **enter**

**NOTE:**
- During the development of this project, I posted test testimonials posts and added user records. This was done to test the functionality of the **Add testimonials**, **Edit testimonials** and **Delete testimonials** functions. And to test that testimonials were successfully added, edited and deleted.
- You will also find some comments visible in the testimonials detail, this was also done to test functionality.
- **(All of the testimonials content is simply just placeholder text used to test the functionality of content display for site)**
- The User after the purchase can leave a review.
- Site Admin can do all of the above from the admin panel.
