# SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) and Marketing
## SEO
Keywords and phrases entered as metadata in the head of the HTML document and throughout the main content of the site help search engines find relevant, searchable content.

In order to improve the site search engine ranking two important files were added to the project :

A sitemap.xml file This file was added to help speed up content discovery for search engines when they crawl and index web applications. A robots.txt file This file was added to acknowledge that search engines are allowed on the site and that they may have free access to it. A robots.txt file is a simple text file that tells search engines where they are not allowed to go on a website. It lists out any folders or files that will not be crawled or indexed by search engine spiders.

### Heroku Deployment

This application has been deployed from Github using Heroku. Here's how:

1. Create an account at heroku.com
2. Create an app, give it a name and select a region
3. Go to app settings and set DATABASE_URL to config vars
4. Install the plugins dj-database-url and psycopg2-binary in terminal.
5. Run pip3 freeze > requirements.txt so both are added to the requirements.txt file
6. Create a Procfile with the text: web: gunicorn your_app_name.wsgi
7. Ensure debug is set to false in the settings.py file, add localhost, smartcctv.herokuapp.com to the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in settings.py
8. In the settings.py ensure the connection is to the Heroku postgres database, no indentation if you are not using a separate test database. 
9.  Run "python3 manage.py showmigrations" to check the status of the migrations

10. Run "python3 manage.py migrate" to migrate the database

11. Run "python3 manage.py createsuperuser" to create a super/admin user

13. Run "python3 manage.py loaddata albums.json" on the products file in products/fixtures to create the albums

14. Run "python3 manage.py loaddata tracks.json" on the products file in products/fixtures to create the tracks

15. Install gunicorn (pip install gunicorn) and add it to the requirements.txt file using the command pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

16. Disable collectstatic in Heroku before any code is pushed using the heroku settings config vars: set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC: 1

* Add the following config vars :
  - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  - DATABASE_URL
  - EMAIL_HOST_USER
  - SECRET_KEY
  - SECRET_WH_SECRET
  - STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
  - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

17.  Ensure the following environment variables are set in Heroku

19.  Connect the app to GitHub, and enable automatic deploys from the main if you wish

20.  Click deploy to deploy your application to Heroku for the first time

21.  Click on the link provided to access the application

22.  If you encounter any issues accessing the build logs is a good way to troubleshoot the issue
