 ## SUPERUSER SITE ADMIN FUNCTION:
This site uses Django's Admin functionality for content moderation control. The site has a Superuser with their own login credentials.
 
The Admin panel can be accessed simply from the home page. You can navigate to it by clicking in the URL bar, hit / (forward slash) on keyboard and type admin. Like so: **/admin** and hit **enter**

**NOTE:**
- During the development of this project, I posted test testimonials posts and added user records. This was done to test the functionality of the **Add testimonials**, **Edit testimonials** and **Delete testimonials** functions. And to test that testimonials were successfully added, edited and deleted.
- You will also find some comments visible in the testimonials detail, this was also done to test functionality.
- **(All of the testimonials content is simply just placeholder text used to test the functionality of content display for site)**
- The User after the purchase can leave a review.
- Site Admin can do all of the above from the admin panel.

16. Disable collectstatic in Heroku before any code is pushed using the heroku settings config vars: set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC: 1

17.  Ensure the following environment variables are set in Heroku

18.  Connect the app to GitHub, and enable automatic deploys from the main if you wish

19.  Click deploy to deploy your application to Heroku for the first time
